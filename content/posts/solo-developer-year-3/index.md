It's my third year.

## Project by project

### WanderJest

At the start of the year, I started working on a project called WanderJest. I'm a big fan of live comedy, and I've always found it frustrating that there's no good way of finding comedy shows around me. Often, comedians I love would perform a few miles from my house, and I'd have no idea until months later.

My idea was to build a tool that aggregated together show listings. Kind of like what Fandango is for movie theaters or bandsintown is for bands.

I built WanderJest, and it was the most fun I ever had building a business. I was going to see comedy shows like it was my job. Because it was my job.

The only problem was that it didn't work at all. Even though I was attracting a few dozen users per day, nobody seemed to change their behavior.

My most ambitious project was a "comedy scavenger hunt." I paid hundreds of dollars to advertise it and offered hundreds more in prize money. The idea was that fans would win points by attending local comedy shows, so the show organizers would pay to have their shows earn extra points in the scavenger hunt.

If this idea seems bizarre to you, it's because I planned the contest in February 2020 and it was supposed to run throughout March 2020.

When was this contest scheduled? March 2020.

People suggested I pivot into livestreamed comedy shows, but I couldn't find the motivation. I love seeing live comedy, but I can't even sit through a livestreamed comedy show. I don't know why, but I don't enjoy it, even though I do enjoy comedy podcasts.

### Portfolio Rebalancer

When it became clear that WanderJest wouldn't be viable for a few months or years, I wasn't sure what to do. With all the financial volatility, I was debating whether to rebalance my portfolio. I had just been doing it with spreadsheets where I'd keep plugging in trades until my split was correct. It was clearly something a computer could do, but I never bothered.

But I figured now would be a good opportunity.

I got several people to try it, but it's hard to market. Investing communities are defensive towards anyone promoting their own product because there are so many snake oil salesmen. I got a stream of Google users, but nobody wanted to pay for access.

I ended up just removing the paywall. It works, but it's limited to Vanguard funds, and it doesn't yet support limiting trades between accounts.

### Is It Keto

After Portfolio Rebalancer, I came back to Is It Keto, a site I started in 2018. I've managed it off and on since then. I always get bored because I'm not passionate about keto, but then I keep getting drawn back in because it was my only project that earned money consistently.

My new idea for the site was to move to "templatized" content. For all of Is It Keto's life, I wrote the articles by hand or hired writers and carefully edited the content to make each article artisenal and special. But I only earned about $0.01 per visitor in ads and affiliate money, and the average article only received about XX unique visitors per month. Meanwhile, it generally cost me ~$100 in content writer salary and 30-60 minutes of editing time.

This wasn't sustainable, so I thought about templatizing content. I had a friend who had successfully built several content businesses by purchasing databases and building friendly websites around them. He mixed hand-written articles with templatized content.

### TinyPilot

While I was working on Is It Keto, I was.

## Zero to $1k is harder than $1k to $10k

I thought the next step would be to find a product that generates $1k/month in revenue, and then it would be another order of magnitude to reach $10k.

I felt like I was neglecting the business, and it nevertheless grew by 25% to $15k in revenue.
