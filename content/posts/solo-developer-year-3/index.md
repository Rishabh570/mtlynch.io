Today is the third anniversary of me [quitting my developer job at Google](/why-i-quit-google/) to build my own software business. I posted updates at the end of my [first](/solo-developer-year-1/) and [second](/solo-developer-year-2/) years on my own, so I figured I'd keep up the tradition.

## The big picture

This is the year that things finally began clicking into place for me. I set a goal to earn $20k in revenue by the end of the year.

For the first six months, it didn't look like I was going to make it. I was eking out $300/month from my various projects, and I was looking for some 10x improvement to help me meet my goal.

Starting in July, I started a new project that was obviously a winner right out of the gate. I ended the year with $XXk in revenue.

Okay, I'm still not making a profit, but that's just a detail.

## Project by project

### WanderJest

At the start of the year, I started working on a project called WanderJest. I'm a big fan of live comedy, and I've always found it frustrating that there's no good way of finding comedy shows around me. Often, comedians I love would perform a few miles from my house, and I'd have no idea until months later.

My idea was to build a tool that aggregated together show listings. Kind of like what Fandango is for movie theaters or bandsintown is for bands.

I built WanderJest, and it was the most fun I ever had building a business. I was going to see comedy shows like it was my job. Because it was my job.

The only problem was that it didn't work at all. Even though I was attracting a few dozen users per day, nobody seemed to change their behavior.

My most ambitious project was a "comedy scavenger hunt." I paid hundreds of dollars to advertise it and offered hundreds more in prize money. The idea was that fans would win points by attending local comedy shows, so the show organizers would pay to have their shows earn extra points in the scavenger hunt.

If this idea seems bizarre to you, it's because I planned the contest in February 2020 and it was supposed to run throughout March 2020.

When was this contest scheduled? March 2020.

People suggested I pivot into livestreamed comedy shows, but I couldn't find the motivation. I love seeing live comedy, but I can't even sit through a livestreamed comedy show. I don't know why, but I don't enjoy it, even though I do enjoy comedy podcasts.

### Portfolio Rebalancer

When it became clear that WanderJest wouldn't be viable for a few months or years, I wasn't sure what to do. With all the financial volatility, I was debating whether to rebalance my portfolio. I had just been doing it with spreadsheets where I'd keep plugging in trades until my split was correct. It was clearly something a computer could do, but I never bothered.

But I figured now would be a good opportunity.

I got several people to try it, but it's hard to market. Investing communities are defensive towards anyone promoting their own product because there are so many snake oil salesmen. I got a stream of Google users, but nobody wanted to pay for access.

I ended up just removing the paywall. It works, but it's limited to Vanguard funds, and it doesn't yet support limiting trades between accounts.

### Is It Keto

After Portfolio Rebalancer, I came back to Is It Keto, a site I started in 2018. I've managed it off and on since then. I always get bored because I'm not passionate about keto, but then I keep getting drawn back in because it was my only project that earned money consistently.

My new idea for the site was to move to "templatized" content. For all of Is It Keto's life, I wrote the articles by hand or hired writers and carefully edited the content to make each article artisenal and special. But I only earned about $0.01 per visitor in ads and affiliate money, and the average article only received about XX unique visitors per month. Meanwhile, it generally cost me ~$100 in content writer salary and 30-60 minutes of editing time.

This wasn't sustainable, so I thought about templatizing content. I had a friend who had successfully built several content businesses by purchasing databases and building friendly websites around them. He mixed hand-written articles with templatized content.

### TinyPilot

While I was working on Is It Keto, I was thinking about building a new VM server. I was beginning to hit the limits of my old one, and I wanted to correct some mistakes I made in building it.

The biggest mistake I made in building my first server was not considering remote management. If I ever ran into issues booting the server, I had to drag it over to my desk, swap all my keyboard and monitor cables, fix the issue, then put everything back.

I had read that the Raspberry Pi could emulate a keyboard. I was pretty sure it could capture video, too. So if I could get that working, I could build my own KVM over IP device. I started tinkering with it around May.

I wrote a blog post about it thinking that it could be a neat side project. My hope was that I could make an extra $100 per week selling little kits to reproduce my project. But I posted it to Hacker News, and I sold out within hours.

I realized there was a real business here that was way bigger than any other project I was working on.

### mtlynch.io (this blog)

One of my the changes I made this year was thinking more strategically about my blog. I can use it to bring attention to my projects.

The big insight I had is that I need a plan to share my blog posts before I write them. In 2019, I wrote so many blog posts with the attitude of, "This is what's top of mind right now, so I'm going to write it and see what happens." Sometimes they'd find an audience, but more often they wouldn't.

For example, my post, "Hiring Content Writers: A Guide for Small Businesses." That's my longest-ever post. It took me about three months to write. It's also one of my least popular. And it's frustrating because when I find people on reddit asking how to hire a content writer, I share the article and they thank me profusely and say it's exactly what they needed. The problem is that I can't reach communities of people trying to hire content writers. Communities around starting businesses are extremely defensive against people pushing low-quality snake oil content that you can't really reach a critical mass of people.

I realized I needed to come up with a plan for finding an audience before I wrote the post. If I had no way of reaching an audience, don't write the post.

Every article except one reached the front page of Hacker News, and four of them reached the #1 slot.

### Hit the Front Page of Hacker News

I gave a talk at my peer mentorship group called "How to be a Sort of Successful Software Blogger." I liked writing it, but as I mentioned above, I didn't have anywhere to share it.

## Lessons learned

### Success in one project makes everything easier

I noticed that once I started talking about earning money, people became more interested in following me on Facebook. I write monthly retrospectives, and I used to post them occasionally to the /r/SideProject subreddit, but once my revenue reached $10k, people would get excited about them. Even when the retrospective was me saying how I did a bad job that month and neglected my business, people were still excited that my revenues grew.

### The first $1k is harder than the next $9k

I thought the next step would be to find a product that generates $1k/month in revenue, and then it would be another order of magnitude to reach $10k.

I felt like I was neglecting the business, and it nevertheless grew by 25% to $15k in revenue.

TinyPilot feels like it's growing on its own.

### There's no shame in product-founder fit

One of the considerations I've had in all the businesses I've ever started is that I wanted to be able to tune out on evenings and weekends. One of the things I hated most at Google was being "on call" where a page could wake me up at 3 AM, and I'd have to get up and fix the issue, then go to work like normal the next day.

None of my projects require me to carry a pager. Is It Keto could have a complete outage over the weekend, and it wouldn't matter much.  I'd lose a little bit of ad revenue, but that's it.

Imagine instead that I had built a web service called Is It Lethal, and it allowed pharmacies to automatically check whether prescription drug combinations could kill their patients. That's the kind of thing that needs to be online all the time, and if it's down at 4 AM, someone should page me. An outage there would be A Big Deal.

I was always a little embarrassed that I had this restriction. I felt like I wasn't a *real* entrepreneur by limiting myself in this way. I wondered if the reason none of my products had taken off was because I was being too prissy about carrying a pager.

After my last year-in-review, Patrick McKenzie recommended I watch a Jason Cohen video. Jason Cohen has launched several successful startups. In the video, he recommends that solo founders avoid businesses where an outage is A Big Deal.

One of the features TinyPilot users have asked for is cloud management. It would be lucrative, as customers would likely pay $20/month for it, but it also makes me a single point of failure, where I have to care about what happens on the weekends or evenings.
