It introduces interesting ideas, but many of the arguments are flimsy, and he cherry picks statistics, often misrepresenting them or getting them outright wrong.

One of my biggest disagreements with the book was that he asserts that no ethnic group is measurably different than any other ethnic group in any dimension. For example, the fact that Jews are disproportionately represented in occupations like law or medicine is not a consequence of education being valued in Jewish culture. In Kendi's view, the prevalence of Jews in these professions is a coincidence.

One of the most shocking aspects of the book was Kendi's sloppiness with facts. I appreciated that he footnoted most of his claims with citations, but when I dug into them, I was disappointed to find how many were secondary or even tertiary sources. I'd frequently check a source only to find that it was a news article referencing another news article that referenced an academic study. In several instances, the fact became distorted after traveling through so many indirect sources.

## Did eugenicists perform 700,000 involuntary sterilizations per year?

The most egregious error I found in *How to Be an Antiracist* was this line on page 189:

>Gender racism was behind the growing number of involuntary sterilizations of Black women by eugenicist physicians &mdash; two hundred thousand cases in 1970, rising to seven hundred thousand in 1980.

700,000 involuntary sterilizations per year? That's a shockingly high number, which surprised me because I'd never heard numbers anywhere close to that. There were [26.5 million black Americans in 1980](https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/wepeople/we-1.pdf), so this would mean doctors were nonconsensually sterilizing 6-7% of reproductive age black women every year.

The source for this statistic is *Killing the Black Body* by Dorothy E. Roberts, pages 90-96. That book is [available on OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2624319W/Killing_the_black_body?edition=killingblackbody00robe), so I looked it up and found the line that Kendi seems to be referencing:

>But most sterilizations of Black women were not performed under the auspices of the eugenic laws. The violence was committed by doctors paid by the government to provide health care for these women. During the 1970s sterilization became the most rapidly growing form of birth control in the United States, rising from 200,000 cases in 1970 to over 700,000 in 1980.

This line contains a footnote that points to Thomas M. Shapiro's *Population Control Politics: Women, Sterilization, and Reproductive Choice*, also [available on OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5358681W/Population_control_politics?edition=populationcontro0000shap). I found the statistic on page 6:

>Unlike the preceding cases of abuse and coercion, voluntary sterilization is commonplace. In the 1970s there was a dramatic increase in the use of sterilization as a method of contraception. Female sterilization is the most rapidly growing form of birth control in the United States, rising from 200,000 cases in 1970 to over 700,000 in 1980.

Shapiro has a list of citations, but they're not tied to specific lines, so it's hard to figure out the real source of these statistics.

In any case, it's obvious that eugenicist physicians did **not** perform 700,000 involuntary sterilizations per year on black women. The 700,000 figure is the number of American women *across all races* who *chose* sterilizations in 1980.

Usually, I use the "Key Takeaways" section to share the lessons from the book that I'm applying to my life. This book is a bit different in that I don't agree with many of his points, but I think they're helpful to keep in mind as another perspective to consider or to understand terms when reading other sources for race theory.
