## Highlights

*

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Release a high-end version of TinyPilot that arrives pre-assembled in a custom case

* **Result**: Released TinyPilot Voyager
* **Grade**: A

TODO

### Release the first version of [TinyPilot Pro](https://tinypilotkvm.com/pro)

* **Result**: I haven't even figured out how to distribute TinyPilot Pro
* **Grade**: F

Releasing Voyager took longer than I anticipated, so I punted this until December.

### Figure out how to properly track the source of customers who end up completing purchases

* **Result**: I think I'm doing this properly now?
* **Grade**: C-

I figured out how to track sessions as users move between [tinypilotkvm.com](https://tinypilotkvm.com) and my Shopify domain for the checkout process (thanks to [this suggestion from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/jnkkzu/my_first_10k_month_selling_a_raspberry_pibased/gb3i0cz/?context=3)), but Google Analytics still claims 53% of visitors who complete a purchase typed in the [tinypilotkvm.com](https://tinypilotkvm.com) URL manually, which seems unlikely.

Another founder made a compelling argument to me that my largely tech audience is probably using ad-blockers anyway. That means they won't show up in analytics anyway. It's also not unusual for people to come back to the site later rather than complete their purchase the instant they see an ad, so I might be overindexing on trying to trace the source of purchases.

## Hardcoding configuration comes back to bite me

## Topic 2

## My first paid course

As of this writing, I've sold XX pre-orders, and I'm currently panicking that I made a huge mistake.

## Legacy projects

Here are some brief updates on projects that I still maintain but are not the primary focus of my development:

## Wrap up

### What got done?

### Lessons learned

* New products need new processes
  * I underestimated how much additional time and stress Voyager would create.

### Goals for next month

* Release the first version of [TinyPilot Pro](https://tinypilotkvm.com/pro)
* Publish a follow-up blog post about code reviews
